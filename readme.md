##Ruby Server/CraigslistScraper

This is a ruby server built on Sinatra and Nokogiri. The root will display a list of the current software job postings on craigslist: south florida. It allows users to specify a category for search with `?job=''` query strings. Any search that conforms with craigslist's syntax will run on the server. 

To run navigate to the server directory and execute `ruby server.rb`.
